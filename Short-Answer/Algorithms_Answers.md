#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) code will run once no matter the size of n, and will repeat once the while loop starts. This code would be linear


b) O(n) as the input size increases, the runtime will increase


c) O(n^2) Nested while loop will make O(n) multiply itself
